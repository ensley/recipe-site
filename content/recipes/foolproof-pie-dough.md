From Cook's Illustrated. Makes enough for one 9-inch double-crust pie.

Gluten forms readily in water, but it won't form in alcohol. By replacing some of the water in our
recipe with vodka (which contains 40 percent ethanol but just 60 percent water), we're able to
add more liquid to the dough so it stays soft and malleable, but without increasing the danger of
the crust turning tough. (Note: Any 80-proof spirit will work. The alcohol burns off in the oven,
along with any flavor.)

## Ingredients

- 2 1/2 cups (12 1/2 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon table salt
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch slices
- 1/2 cup chilled solid vegetable shortening, cut into 4 pieces
- 1/4 cup vodka, cold
- 1/4 cup cold water

## Directions

1. Process 1 1/2 cups flour, salt, and sugar in food
processor until combined, about two 1-second
pulses. Add butter and shortening and process
until homogeneous dough just starts to collect
in uneven clumps, about 15 seconds (dough will
resemble cottage cheese curds and there should
be no uncoated flour). Scrape bowl with rubber
spatula and redistribute dough evenly around
processor blade.

2. Add remaining cup flour and pulse until mixture 
is evenly distributed around bowl and mass
of dough has been broken up, 4 to 6 quick pulses.
Empty mixture into medium bowl.

3. Sprinkle vodka and water over mixture. With
rubber spatula, use folding motion to mix, pressing
down on dough until dough is slightly tacky and
sticks together. Divide dough into 2 even balls
and flatten each into 4-inch disk. Wrap each in
plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 45 minutes
for up to 2 days.
