This classic French dish can be baked up to eight hours ahead. Let it cool completely,
then cover loosely with foil, and refrigerate. To serve, reheat in a 350-degree oven.

## Ingredients

- 6 medium russet potatoes (2 3/4 pounds total), peeled
- 6 tablespoons butter, melted
- coarse salt and ground pepper

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450Â° Using a food
processor with a slicing blade or a
sharp knife, slice potatoes as thinly as
possible, 1/4 inch thick or thinner. (Do
not place sliced potatoes in water; the
starch is needed to bind the layers.)

2. Brush bottom of a 10-inch cast-iron
skillet with 1 1/2 tablespoons butter.
Starting in center of pan, arrange
potato slices, slightly overlapping,
in circular pattern, covering surface.
Brush with another 1 1/2 tablespoons
butter; season well with salt and
pepper. Repeat for two more layers.

3. Place over high heat until butter
in pan sizzles, 2 to 4 minutes.

4. Transfer to oven; bake until 
potatoes are fork-tender, about 1 hour.
Remove from oven. Run a small
spatula around edges of potatoes;
slide large spatula underneath
potatoes to loosen. Carefully invert
onto a plate, and cut into wedges.
