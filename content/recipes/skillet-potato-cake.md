The trick here is to start the potato cake on top of the stove to heat it quickly, then
transfer it to the oven where it will develop a crunchy crust.

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 pounds baking potatoes (about 2), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch chunks
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 3 scallions, including green parts, thinly sliced (about 1/2 cup)
- salt and pepper

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425Â°. Put the 
potatoes in a medium saucepan of salted
water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to
medium, and cook until tender, about
10 minutes. Drain.

2. In a 10-inch cast-iron skillet, heat the
butter and oil over medium heat. Stir in
the potatoes, scallions, 1/4 teaspoon salt,
and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. With the back
of a large spoon, press the potatoes into
the pan, crushing them slightly.

3. Bake the potato cake until the edges
are golden brown, about 20 minutes.
Loosen the cake with a heatproof 
spatula if necessary. Cover the pan with a
plate, flip over, and remove the pan.
