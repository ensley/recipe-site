The magic of food coloring turns this cake a vivid red. Some
other magic gives it its sumptuous, velvety texture. The combination
is a knockout.

## Ingredients

**Cake:**

- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda 
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon red food coloring (yes, 1 tablespoon)  
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
- 3 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon white vinegar

**Frosting:**

- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease and flour two 9-inch cake pans.

In a bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

Combine the buttermilk and the food coloring. Set aside.

In a mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar Add the eggs, one at
a time, and beat until thoroughly combined. Alternately, add some of the flour
mixture, then some of the buttermilk mixture, until all is incorporated. Add
the vanilla extract and vinegar, and beat until a uniform color is achieved.

Spread the batter evenly in the pans and hake for 30 minutes, or until a
toothpick inserted into the center of each layer comes out clean. Cool in the
pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto racks and cool completely.

Make the frosting: Place the flour in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and gradually
whisk in the milk. Continue to whisk constantly until the mixture becomes
thick and all the small bubbles on top disappear. Remove from the heat and
cool to room temperature. (If you are in a hurry, you can place the pan in the
sink and add cold water halfway up the sides of the pan. It will then cool in
minutes.)

In a mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until fluffy. Add the
vanilla extract and then the cooled milk/flour mixture. Beat on high until the
frosting is the consistency of whipped cream and the sugar is dissolved. Do not
overbeat. Spread between the layers and on the top and sides of the cake.
