The almonds will continue to toast while the biscotti
bake, so toast the nuts only until they are just fragrant. 
Makes 30 cookies.

## Ingredients

- 1 1/4 cups (6 1/4 ounces) whole almonds, lightly toasted
- 1 3/4 cups (8 3/4 ounces) all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs, plus 1 large white beaten with pinch salt
- 1 cup (7 ounces) sugar
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Vegetable oil spray

## Directions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat
oven to 325 degrees. Using ruler and pencil, draw
two 8 by 3-inch rectangles, spaced 4 inches apart, on
piece of parchment paper. Grease baking sheet and
place parchment on it, ink side down.

2. Pulse 1 cup almonds in food processor until
coarsely chopped, 8 to 10 pulses; transfer to bowl
and set aside. Process remaining 1/4 cup almonds
in food processor until finely ground, about 45
seconds, Add flour, baking powder, and salt; process 
to combine, about 15 seconds. Transfer flour
mixture to second bowl. Process 2 eggs in now-empty
food processor until lightened in color and
almost doubled in volume, about 3 minutes. With
processor running, slowly add sugar until thoroughly
combined, about 15 seconds. Add melted butter, 
almond extract, and vanilla and process until
combined, about 10 seconds. Transfer egg mixture
to medium bowl. Sprinkle half of flour mixture
over egg mixture and, using spatula, gently fold
until just combined. Add remaining flour mixture
and chopped almonds and gently fold until just
combined.

3. Divide batter in half. Using floured hands,
form each half into 8 by 3-inch rectangle, using lines
on parchment as guide. Spray each loaf lightly with
oil spray. Using rubber spatula lightly coated with oil
spray, smooth tops and sides of rectangles. Gently
brush tops of loaves with egg white wash. Bake
until loaves are golden and just beginning to crack
on top, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating pan halfway
through baking.

4. Let loaves cool on baking sheet for 30 minutes.
Transfer loaves to cutting board. Using serrated
knife, slice each loaf on slight bias into 1/2-inch-thick
slices. Lay slices, cut side down, about 1/4 inch
apart on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Bake
until crisp and golden brown on both sides, about
35 minutes, flipping slices halfway through baking.
Let cool completely before serving. Biscotti can be
stored in airtight container for up to 1 month.
