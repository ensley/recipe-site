Make it the day or even two days before — great for a dinner party where
you won't have a lot of time.

## Ingredients

- 1 tin foil pan (that’s the easy way)
- 1 slab brisket (get a good one from the butcher, not too fatty)
- 1 bottle of beer
- 1 package Lipton dried onion soup
- 1 sweet onion
- 1 can cranberry sauce with whole cranberries
- 1 1/2 cup chopped carrots (3)
- 1 1/2 cup chopped celery (3 stalks)
- Couple of pats of butter

## Directions

Place brisket into large foil pan.

Pour the beer over it.

Sprinkle the Lipton soup over it.

Sprinkle the rest of the ingredients over it as well.

Bake covered (use foil) for 4 hours at 350° degrees.
Let it cool a little before you uncover it as it is boiling hot.

Uncover, continue to let it cool. Carve it; then refrigerator it overnight.

Reheat it the next day for an hour or so (covered with foil) at about 350°.
