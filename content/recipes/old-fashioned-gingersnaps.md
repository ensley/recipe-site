(from Mary Meade’s Country Cookbook)

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup shortening
- 1 cups sugar 
- 1 beaten egg
- 1/2 cup dark molasses
- 2-1/4 cups flour
- 1 tsp. baking soda
- 1-1/2 tsp. ginger
- 1/2 tsp. salt

## Directions

Cream shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in egg, and then molasses. Sift together
flour, baking soda, ginger, and salt. Stir into creamed mixture. Shape into small balls and roll in
sugar. Place on lightly greased baking sheet 2-3 inches apart. Bake at 350° for about 15
minutes. Cookies flatten and crackle during baking.

## Tips

Use a small ice cream scoop to form balls. (Rinse with warm water after every five
cookies.) Don’t sugar the bottom of cookies or they will burn. Use parchment paper on cookie
pan for best looking cookie. Dough can be chilled overnight. Let come to room temperature
before baking. I usually make a double batch. These freeze well.
