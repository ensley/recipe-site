## Ingredients

**Pastry Cream:**

- 2 cups half-and-half
- 6 large egg yolks
- 1/2 cup sugar
- pinch table salt
- 1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
- 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into four pieces
- 1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract

**Cake:**

- 1-1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 3/4 teaspoon table salt
- 3/4 cup whole milk
- 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter
- 1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3 large eggs
- 1-1/2 cups sugar

**Glaze:**

- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons light corn syrup
- 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped fine

## Directions

**For the Pastry Cream:** Heat half-and-half in medium saucepan over medium heat until just simmering.
Meanwhile, whisk yolks, sugar, and salt in medium bowl until smooth. Add flour to yolk mixture and
whisk until incorporated. Remove half-and-half from heat and, whisking constantly, slowly add 1/2 cup to
yolk mixture to temper. Whisking constantly, return tempered yolk mixture to half-and-half in
saucepan. Return saucepan to medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture thickens
slightly, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to simmer, whisking constantly, 8
minutes.

Increase heat to medium and cook, whisking vigorously, until bubbles burst on surface, 1 to 2 minutes.
Remove saucepan from heat; whisk in butter and vanilla until butter is melted and incorporated. Strain
pastry cream through fine-mesh strainer set over medium bowl. Press lightly greased parchment paper
directly on surface and refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours.

**For the Cake:** Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Lightly grease two
9-inch round cake pans with nonstick cooking spray and line with parchment. Whisk flour, baking
powder, and salt together in medium bowl. Heat milk and butter in small saucepan over low heat until
butter is melted. Remove from heat, add vanilla, and cover to keep warm.

In stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whip eggs and sugar at high speed until light and airy,
about 5 minutes. Remove mixer bowl from stand. Add hot milk mixture and whisk by hand until
incorporated. Add dry ingredients and whisk until incorporated.

Working quickly, divide batter evenly between prepared pans. Bake until tops are light brown and
toothpick inserted in center of cakes comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes.

Transfer cakes to wire rack and cool completely in pan, about 2 hours. Run small plastic knife around
edge of pans, then invert cakes onto wire rack. Carefully remove parchment, then reinvert cakes.

**To Assemble:** Place one cake round on large plate. Whisk pastry cream briefly, then spoon onto center
of cake. Using offset spatula, spread evenly to cake edge. Place second layer on pastry cream, bottom
side up, making sure layers line up properly. Press lightly on top of cake to level. Refrigerate cake while
preparing glaze.

**For the Glaze:** Bring cream and corn syrup to simmer in small saucepan over medium heat. Remove
from heat and add chocolate. Whisk gently until smooth, 30 seconds. Let stand, whisking occasionally, 
until thickened slightly, about 5 minutes.

Pour glaze onto center of cake. Use offset spatula to spread glaze to edge of cake, letting excess drip
decoratively down sides. Chill finished cake 3 hours before slicing. Cake may be made up to 24 hours 
before serving.
