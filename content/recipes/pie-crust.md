**Important:** Use a canvas pastry cloth and rolling pin stocking to roll out this crust.
Generously flour both the cloth and stocking before rolling crust. Otherwise, it will stick.

The listed ingredient quantities yield two crusts. I suggest making both crusts and freezing
one for later use.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup Crisco
- 1 tablespoon milk
- 1/4 cup boiling water

## Directions

Combine flour and salt in small bowl and stir. Set aside.

Put Crisco and milk in medium-size bowl. Pour boiling water on top. Mix at medium
speed with electric mixer (or whip with fork) until liquids are absorbed into Crisco. Add
flour and continue mixing until flour is absorbed. Using spatula and hands, round into a
ball, then flatten into disc. **Note:** At this point, you can wrap in plastic wrap and 
foil and freeze for later use. Bring to room temperature before rolling out.

Turn out on floured pastry canvas and begin rolling disc from the center out keeping as
round as possible. If cracks start forming on the edge, pinch together. If the crust is
hard to roll, it may be sticking to the pastry canvas. Use rolling pin to lift pastry and
sprinkle more flour underneath.

Roll crust until larger than pie plate. Place rolling pin at edge of crust and lift canvas so
crust rolls part way around the rolling pin. Transfer into pie plate. Cut edges with knife
or scissors so 1/2" overhangs. Fold under and flute edges. Wet fingers if necessary.
For double crust, don’t flute edge until filling is in and top crust fitted on top. Then fold
top over bottom and pinch together.

For pre-baked crust, prick sides and bottom all over the crust with fork. Bake at 425° for
12-14 minutes, until slightly brown.
