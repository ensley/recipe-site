From the 1967 Pillsbury Bake-Off Contest

## Ingredients

- 2 cups plus 3 tablespoons flour, divided
- 2 cups oats
- 1-1/2 cups brown sugar, firmly packed
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2-1/2 sticks (1-1/4 cups) butter, melted
- 12 ounce jar of caramel sauce (Mrs. Richardsonâ€™s is best)
- 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips (6 ounces)
- 1/2 cup chopped pecans or walnuts

## Directions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9x13 pan. In a large bowl, mix together 2 cups flour,
oats, brown sugar, baking soda, and salt. Slowly mix in butter until the mixture is crumbly.

Transfer half the mixture to the baking pan and bake for 8-10 minutes. Remove from oven and
cool for a few minutes. Leave the oven on.

Mix the remaining 3 tablespoons flour with the caramel until smooth. Sprinkle the chocolate
chips and nuts on the baked cookie base. Slowly pour caramel over chips and nuts.

Sprinkle remaining unbaked crumbs on top and bake 18-22 minutes, or until slightly browned.
Cool for at least an hour on the counter, then refrigerate 1-2 hours or until filling is set. Cut into
bars. Further refrigeration is not needed.
