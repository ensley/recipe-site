## Ingredients

- 1/3 cup sugar
- 5 eggs
- 1 can eagle brand sweetened condensed milk
- regular milk, measured by pouring into the eagle milk
can to top
- 1/4 tsp. vanilla

## Directions

Pour sugar into pan and place over moderate heat; shake
pan instead of stirring. Once melted, the sugar will
caramelize quickly; as soon as it does, pour at once into
a 9 inch pie pan. Using hot pads to protect hands, tilt
pan quickly to let syrup flow over bottom and slightly
up sides. If syrup hardens before you finish, set pan on
moderate heat until syrup softens, then continue.

Put eggs into blender, add milk, and vanilla.

Mix thoroughly in blender.

Pour over sugar in 9 inch pie pan.

Place in 350 degree oven for 1 hour, in hot bath. *(see Tip)*
Check as cooking at 45 minutes, 50 minutes, and 55 minutes, to
be sure it doesn't burn.

Let this firm up before inverting onto a serving plate.

## Tip

To make hot bath for Flan, set a slightly larger pan
filled with just enough hot tap water to come up around
the other pan, hold down the pie pan so it won't float.
Then remove the pie pan and put only the pan of water in a
preheating 350 degree oven while you mix the custard.

Let this firm up before inverting onto a serving plate.
