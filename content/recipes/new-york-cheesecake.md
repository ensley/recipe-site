From Cook's Illustrated. Uses a 10" springform pan.

## Ingredients

- Box of Graham cracker crumbs
- 2-1/2 lbs (5 large blocks) of regular cream cheese at room temperature
- 1-1/2 cup sugar
- 1/3 cup sour cream
- 2 tsp. lemon juice
- 2 tsp. vanilla
- 2 egg yolks
- 6 whole eggs

## Directions

**Graham cracker crust:**

Preheat oven to 325°. Melt 4 Tb. butter. Brush bottom and sides of springform pan 
with melted butter, reserving leftover butter for later.

Prepare crust according to directions on box. Put into pan and shake until even. Press
down and even off edges so crumbs don’t go up side. Bake for 13 minutes.

Remove and cool on rack. When cool, brush sides of pan with remaining melted butter.

**Filling:**

After the crust is baked, turn oven up to 500°. 

**Take time when beating in items to get smooth. Scrape beater and bowl well
during mixing.**

Beat cream cheese slowly to break it up, and add a dash of salt. Slowly add in sugar,
scraping the bowl often. Beat all remaining ingredients until smooth, about 6 minutes total. 
Place pan on rimmed baking sheet. Pour batter into pan. Bake for 10 minutes. 
Reduce heat to 200° and bake for about 1-1/2 hours. Center of cheesecake should be 150° when 
tested with instant-read thermometer. Transfer cake to rack and run knife around edge to loosen.

Cool 2-1/2 to 3 hours until barely warm. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for
at least 3 hours, until very cold. Before serving, run knife around edge and remove
sides of pan. (If desired, can slide thin metal spatula between crust and pan bottom to
loosen; then slide cake onto serving plate.) Let cheesecake stand at room temperature
about 30 minutes, then cut into wedges and serve. Cheesecake can be refrigerated up
to 4 days.

The flavor and texture of the cheesecake is best if the cake is allowed to stand at room
temperature for 30 minutes before serving. When cutting the cake, have a pitcher of hot
tap water nearby; dipping the blade of the knife into the water and wiping it clean with a
kitchen towel after each cut helps make neat slices.

Can add a topping, but not necessary for this type.
