## Ingredients

- 1 pint chicken stock or other liquid
- 1 package dry yeast
- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups whole-wheat flour
- 2 cups cracked wheat
- 4 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 cup nonfat dry milk
- 1 tablespoon milk mixed with an egg for brushing biscuits

## Directions

1. Warm the chicken stock in a pan. In the meantime, dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup of warm
water. Combine the flours, cracked wheat, salt and dry milk, then add chicken stock and
dissolved yeast. Knead this for about 3 minutes.

2. Roll the dough into a 1/4" sheet, then cut with cookie cutters or a knife into circles, trees,
tasty cats, dog bones, mailpersons or fire hydrants. (Stay away from sharply pointed
designs.) Brush the egg wash onto the pieces as you are placing them on a baking sheet.

3. There’s no need to let them rise beforehand. Place in a 300-degree oven for 45 minutes, then
turn off the heat and leave them sitting in the oven overnight. In the morning they'll be
bone-hard and absolutely guaranteed to clean your dog’s teeth when properly applied.

**Options:** Add a bit of honey or molasses. Salt may be omitted. Include six eggs for a rich,
golden batch.

## Another recipe

- 2 c. whole-wheat flour
- 1/2 c. all-purpose flour
- 1/4 c. cornmeal
- 1/4 c. sunflower kernels, finely chopped
- 1 t. salt
- 1/4 c. molasses
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 1/4 c. milk
- 2 T. oil

Mix all ingredients, adding more milk if needed to make dough firm. Roll out onto a floured
surface to a 1/2" thickness. Cut out with cookie cutters. Bake on ungreased baking sheets at
350° for 30 minutes or until lightly toasted. To make biscuits harder, leave in oven with the
heat turned off for an hour or more.
