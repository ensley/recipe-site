Makes 3. You can double or triple this recipe as long as you use a pot large enough to
hold the eggs in a single layer, covered by an inch of water.

Eggs are easier to peel if they are older.

For deviled eggs, mash yolks with mayonnaise and yellow mustard. Add salt + 
pepper and serve.

## Ingredients

- 3 large eggs

## Directions

1. Place eggs in medium saucepan, cover with 1 inch of water, and bring to
a boil over high heat. Remove pan from heat, cover, and let sit for 10
minutes. Meanwhile, fill medium bowl with 1 quart water and 1 tray ice
cubes (or equivalent).

2. Transfer eggs to ice bath with slotted spoon and let sit 5 minutes. Tap
each egg all over against countertop to crack shell, then roll egg gently back
and forth several times. Begin peeling from air-pocket (wider) end. The shell
should come off in spiral strips attached to thin membrane. Hard-boiled eggs
can be refrigerated for several days.
