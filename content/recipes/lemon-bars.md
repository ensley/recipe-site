## Ingredients

**Crust:**

- 1-1/2 cups flour
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar
- 1-1/2 sticks cold butter (3/4 cup)

**Filling:**

- 1/2 cup flour
- 3 cups sugar
- 6 eggs
- 1 cup + 2 Tbs. freshly squeezed lemon juice (about 5-6 lemons)
- Powdered sugar for dusting

**To make the crust:**

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Combine the flour and powdered sugar in bowl of an electric mixer. Using the paddle
attachment, add the butter and mix on low speed until mixture is the size of small peas. (Or cut
the butter into the flour with a pastry blender.) Press the crust into the bottom of a 9x13 pan.

Bake the crust for about 20-25 minutes, until golden brown. (Crust can be set aside for a day.)

**To make the filling:**

Stir flour and 1/2 cup of sugar together with fork.

Whisk together the eggs and remaining 2-1/2 cups of sugar in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in
the lemon juice and then the flour/sugar mixture. Slowly pour the lemon filling on top of the
crust.

Bake the lemon bars for about 40 minutes, until the lemon filling is set.

Allow the pan to cool for 30 minutes, slice into squares, and dust with powdered sugar.
