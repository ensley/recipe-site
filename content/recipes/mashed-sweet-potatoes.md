Cutting the sweet potatoes into slices of even thickness is important in getting them to cook at
the same rate. A potato masher will yield slightly lumpy sweet potatoes; a food mill will make a
perfectly smooth pur√©e. The potatoes are best served immediately, but they can be covered
tightly with plastic wrap and kept relatively hot for 30 minutes. This recipe can be doubled in a
Dutch oven; the cooking time will need to be doubled as well.

Serves 4. Published in Cook's Illustrated on November 1, 2002.

## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- 1/2 teaspoon table salt
- 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
- 2 pounds sweet potatoes (about 2 large or 3 medium-small potatoes), peeled, quartered 
  lengthwise, and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices
- pinch ground black pepper

## Directions

1. Combine butter, cream, salt, sugar, and sweet potatoes in 3 to 4 quart saucepan; cook, 
   covered, over low heat, stirring occasionally, until potatoes fall apart when poked with fork, 35
   to 45 minutes.
2. Off heat, mash sweet potatoes in saucepan with potato masher, or transfer mixture to 
   hopper of food mill and process into warmed serving bowl. Stir in pepper; serve immediately.
