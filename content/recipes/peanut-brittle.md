## Ingredients

- 2 cups sugar
- 1 cup brown sugar, firmly packed
- 1/2 cup white corn syrup
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/8 tsp. baking soda
- 1/8 tsp. salt
- 1/4 cup butter, cut into small chunks
- 1-1/4 cups peanuts (can substitute walnuts, pecans or blanched almonds)

## Directions

Butter a 12x8 pan.

Combine both sugars, corn syrup, and water in a medium-size, heavy saucepan. Cook until sugar is
dissolved, then continue coking without stirring, to 300Â°F, or until a little of the mixture dropped in cold
water becomes very brittle. Remove any sugar crystals from sides of pan with damp pastry brush.
Remove from heat. Add baking soda, salt, and butter and stir only enough to mix. Add nuts and tum
immediately into the prepared pan. Do not scrape the saucepan. After a minute or so, try to spread out
the candy to thin it. When cold, break into pieces.
