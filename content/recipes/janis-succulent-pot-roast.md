Firstly, the longer you marinate, the deeper the flavor. I’ve marinated this for up to three days.
You should try to marinate for 24 hours at least before cooking.

**You'll need**: A crock pot and a pan for searing.

## Ingredients

- Large boneless chuck roast, not too fatty
- Some flour (and salt mixed in) to dip chuck into
- A bag of carrots
- A dozen red potatoes or white rose, which ever you prefer
- A large, sweet onion
- 1 pkge. Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix

**Marinade:**

- 1/2 bottle of flavorful red wine, preferably a cab, nothing too sweet
- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- Just a tad of maple syrup
- Some beef bouillon to taste
- 2 bay leaves

**Gravy:**

- I make my own but also add a packaged “brown gravy”. So buy a classic ‘brown gravy’ (you
won't need to add water, you'll instead use the juice from the roast to thicken! I like KNORR as
it’s not so salty)
- A chunk of butter
- Juice from the crock pot

## Directions

Marinate the crap out of the meat, turning it at least twice a day if you are around.

On the morning you plan to cook it, heat a pan and sear the meat on all sides (this only takes a
few minutes on each side if the pan if hot enough. The oil on it helps sear it, so you don’t need
to add any more. You want that deep, dark color.) Do not discard the marinade! Reserve 1 1/2 cups for
the gravy. Place carrots in the bottom of crock pot first. I cut them in half. Then add potatoes 
(also cut in half) and onion (large slices).

Sprinkle some of the soup mix on these veggies. Then place the meat on top of the veggies.
Sprinkle remaining soup mix on meat. Finish off by adding most of the marinade to the pot.

Cook on high for two hours, then lower heat and cook another four hours, or until the meat is so
tender it wants to fall apart. Your veggies will be WAY done. If you like them not so done, you
might want to remove them after about five hours. Make the gravy just before serving.

## Variations

Sometimes I add a little maple syrup to the marinade. Sometimes I add a can of beer to the pot.
