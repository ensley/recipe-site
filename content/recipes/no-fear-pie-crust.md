Makes one 9-inch Pie Shell

## Ingredients

- 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon table salt
- 8 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 stick), softened but still cool
- 2 ounces cream cheese , softened but still cool

## Directions

1. Lightly coat 9-inch Pyrex pie plate with cooking spray. Whisk flour, sugar, and salt together in bowl.

2. With electric mixer at medium-high speed, beat butter and cream cheese in large bow, stopping once
or twice to scrape down beater and sides of bowl, until completely homogenous, about 2 minutes. Add
flour mixture and combine on medium-low until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, about 20 seconds.
Scrape down sides of bowl. Increase mixer speed to medium-high and beat until dough begins to form
large clumps, about 30 seconds. Reserve 3 tablespoons of dough. Turn remaining dough onto lightly
floured surface, gather into ball, and flatten into 6-inch disk. Transfer disk to greased pie plate.

3. Press dough evenly over bottom of pie plate toward sides, using heel of your hand. Hold plate up to
light to ensure that dough is evenly distributed. With your fingertips, continue to work
dough over bottom of plate and up sides until evenly distributed.

4. On floured surface, roll reserved dough into 12-inch rope. Divide into three pieces, roll each piece Into
8-inch rope, and form fluted edge. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 1 hour.

5. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Lightly prick bottom of crust with
fork. Bake until golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool on wire rack. (If large bubbles form, wait until crust
is fully baked, then gently press on bubbles with kitchen towel. Bubbles will settle as crust cools.)
