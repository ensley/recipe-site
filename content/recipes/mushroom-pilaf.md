## Ingredients

- 1 (4 oz.) can mushroom pieces
- 1 c. chopped onion
- 1/4 c. butter
- 1/4 c. cooking oil
- 2 c. raw regular rice
- 3 cans beef or chicken broth
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 2 tsp. oregano leaves
- 1/2 c. slivered almonds

## Directions

Drain mushrooms; reserve liquid. Add enough water to make 2 cups. Set aside.

Sauté mushrooms and onion in melted butter and oil in large saucepan until tender, but not
brown. Stir in rice and brown slightly, stirring occasionally. Stir in reserved liquid, beef broth,
salt and oregano. Bring mixture to a boil. Pour into 3-qt. casserole; cover.

Bake in 375° oven for 30 minutes or until rice is tender. (May need another 10-20 minutes to
absorb moisture.) Garnish with fresh parsley if desired. Makes 8 to 10 servings.
