## Ingredients

* 1 loaf French bread
* 1 pound grated Swiss cheese
* 1/2 pound chopped mushrooms
* 3 green onions, chopped
* 1 cup butter, melted
* 2 tbsp. poppy seeds
* 2 tsp. lemon juice
* 1 tsp. dry mustard
* 1 tsp. salt

## Directions

Slice French bread on the diagonal in both directions to make a criss-cross
pattern. Toss the cheese, mushrooms and onion together to mix. Place the loaf
on a baking sheet with a piece of foil under the loaf to catch the mess. Stuff the
crevices of the loaf with the cheese mixture. Combine the remaining ingredients
and drizzle over the bread.

Bake at 350 for about 45 minutes or until the loaf is nicely browned and the
cheese melted.
