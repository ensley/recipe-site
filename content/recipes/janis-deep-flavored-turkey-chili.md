A double batch or crockpot full — feeds a party

## Ingredients

- 2 med sweet onions, chopped
- 2 lbs. lean turkey meat (2 pkgs. ground)
- Pepper
- 1 large can tomato pieces w/liquid (forgot to measure — 20 oz?)
- 2 small cans tomato paste (organic has great flavor)
- 1 can of beer 
- 1/2 C. red wine
- 5 heaping TBS chili powder (I usually use California, but you can 
add a tiny bit Arbol if you’re into chili types - hot but good flavor).
- 4 TBS beef bullion
- 1-1/2 Tsp. ground cumin
- 1 TBS Hershey’s unsweetened cocoa powder (deep flavor!)
- 4 15oz. cans (60 oz) pinto beans (drain unless you want more liquid)

## Directions

In a large pan brown onions, turkey, and pepper. (Don’t add salt! 
Til later, your bullion may be salty)

Now add remaining ingredients.

DO NOT ADD SALT: Usually, bullion is salty!
Bring ingredients to a boil, then simmer for an hour.

Serve with shredded mex or cheddar cheese on top!

**Note:** Your chili powder may vary if you use the real stuff, and
some may be really hot ... which means you’d want to use less.
Regular grocer’s won’t be — you might want to add cayenne to
taste.

Remember, your beef flavoring might be very, very salty.
If you find your chili is too salty, add a little tomato sauce and 
beer.
