## Ingredients

**Cake:**

- 3 c. unsifted flour
- 1 tsp. baking powder
- 1/8 tsp. baking soda
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1/2 tsp. ground nutmeg
- 1 cup butter (2 sticks), softened
- 2-1/4 c. granulated sugar
- 4 large eggs
- 2 tsp. vanilla extract
- 3/4 c. + 1 Tb. prepared [eggnog]({{< relref "eggnog" >}})
- 3 Tb. dark rum

**Glaze:**

- 5 Tb. butter, cut into chunks
- 1/2 c. granulated sugar
- 1/3 c. dark rum
- 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract

## Directions

**For cake**, preheat oven to 350Â°. Grease a 10" bundt pan with shortening and flour (or spray
with cooking spray with flour). Set aside. (Can also bake in 3 loaf pans. Double the glaze for
loaf pans.)

Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and nutmeg onto a sheet of wax paper.
Set aside.

Cream butter with an electric mixer at medium speed for 3-4 minutes. Gradually add sugar,
beating until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating just until the yellow yolk
disappears. Blend in vanilla.

On low speed, add flour mixture and eggnog to butter mixture alternately, beginning and ending
with flour mixture. Beat until blended after each addition, scraping bowl frequently. Add rum
and beat 30 seconds. Spoon batter into pan, smoothing top with spatula.

Bake on center oven rack for 55 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in center of cake
comes out clean. Cool in pan on a wire rack 10 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the glaze. When
glaze is made, unmold cake onto rack with wax paper under the rack. Using a pastry brush or
spoon, apply glaze over cake, using all of the glaze. Cool cake completely and store in airtight
container. Can freeze at this point. Cake can be made up to three days ahead of serving if kept
in airtight container.

**For glaze:** While cake is cooling in pan, place butter, sugar and rum in a nonreactive pan. Set
over low heat and stir until the sugar dissolves. Increase heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat
and simmer 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla.
