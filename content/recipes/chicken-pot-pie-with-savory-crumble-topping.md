This recipe relies on two unusual ingredients: soy sauce and tomato paste. Do not omit them.
They don't convey their distinctive tastes but greatly deepen the savory flavor of the filling.
When making the topping, do not substitute milk or half-and-half for the heavy cream.

Serves 6. From Cook's Illustrated, September 2010

## Ingredients

**Filling:**

- 1 1/2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts and/or thighs
- 3 cups chicken broth
- 2 Tbs. vegetable oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped fine
- 3 medium carrots, peeled and cut crosswise in 1/4" slices
- 2 stalks celery, chopped fine
- Salt and pepper
- 10 oz. mushrooms, cleaned and sliced thin
- 1 tsp. soy sauce
- 1 tsp. tomato paste
- 4 Tbs. (1/2 stick) butter
- 1/2 cup flour
- 1 cup whole milk
- 2 tsp. lemon juice
- 3 Tbs. minced fresh parsley
- 3/4 cup frozen peas

**Crumble Topping:**

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp. baking powder
- 3/4 tsp. salt
- 1/2 tsp. pepper
- 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper
- 6 Tbs. butter, cut into 1/2" cubes and chilled
- 1 oz. Parmesan cheese, finely grated (about 1/2 cup)
- 3/4 cup plus 2 Tbs. heavy cream

## Directions

1. **FOR THE CHICKEN:** Bring chicken and broth to simmer in covered Dutch oven over
medium heat. Cook until chicken is just done, 8 to 12 minutes. Transfer cooked chicken to large
bowl. Pour broth through fine-mesh strainer into liquid measuring cup and reserve. Do not wash
Dutch oven. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees.

2. **FOR THE TOPPING:** Combine flour, baking powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne
pepper in large bowl. Sprinkle butter pieces over top of flour. Using fingers, rub butter into flour
mixture until it resembles coarse cornmeal. Stir in Parmesan. Add cream and stir until just
combined. Crumble mixture into irregularly shaped pieces ranging from 1/2 to 3/4 inch each
onto parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Bake until fragrant and starting to brown, 10 to 13
minutes. Set aside.

3. **FOR THE FILLING:** Heat 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty Dutch oven over medium
heat until shimmering. Add onion, carrots, celery, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper,
cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender, 5 to 7 minutes. While vegetables are
cooking, shred chicken into small bite-size pieces. Transfer cooked vegetables to bowl with
chicken; set aside.

4. Heat remaining tablespoon oil in empty Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering.
Add mushrooms; cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms have released their
juices, about 5 minutes. Remove cover and stir in soy sauce and tomato paste. Increase heat to
medium-high and cook, stirring frequently, until liquid has evaporated, mushrooms are well
browned, and dark fond begins to form on surface of pan, about 5 minutes. Transfer mushrooms
to bowl with chicken and vegetables. Set aside.

5. Heat butter in empty Dutch oven over medium heat. When foaming subsides, stir in flour
and cook 1 minute. Slowly whisk in reserved chicken broth and milk. Bring to simmer, scraping
pan bottom with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits, then continue to simmer until sauce fully
thickens, about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and stir in
lemon juice and 2 tablespoons parsley.

6. Stir chicken-vegetable mixture and peas into sauce. Pour mixture into 13 x 9-inch baking
dish or casserole dish of similar size. Scatter crumble topping evenly over filling. Bake on
rimmed baking sheet until filling is bubbling and topping is well browned, 12 to 15 minutes.
Sprinkle with remaining tablespoon parsley and serve.
