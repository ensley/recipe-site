## Ingredients

- 6 Tbs. olive oil
- 3 large garlic cloves, minced
- 3 tsp. dried oregano
- 2-1/4 lbs. white-skinned potatoes, peeled, each cut into 6 long wedges (about 4-5 large)
- 1 4-lb, chicken, cut into 8 pieces (or 3-4 chicken breasts) *(see Tip)*
- 3 Tbs. fresh lemon juice

## Directions

Preheat oven to 400F. Brush inside of large roasting pan with 2 Tbs. oil. Combine remaining
4 Tbs. oil, garlic, and 1-1/2 tsp. oregano in bowl. Add potatoes and toss to coat. Sprinkle
potatoes with salt and pepper. Sprinkle chicken with remaining 1-1/2 tsp. oregano, salt, and
pepper. Arrange chicken in single layer in center of prepared pan. Arrange potatoes around
chicken. Drizzle chicken with lemon juice and any remaining oil mixture from bowl of potatoes.
Roast chicken and potatoes until chicken is cooked through and potatoes are tender, about 1 hour
10 minutes. Makes 4 servings.

## Tip

If using chicken breasts, cook potatoes for 15 minutes before adding breasts. Turn breasts
halfway through cooking time so they will brown on the other side.
