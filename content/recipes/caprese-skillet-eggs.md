## Ingredients

- 2 Tb. olive oil
- 3 medium tomatoes, chopped
- 1/2 tsp. each salt and pepper
- 4 large eggs
- 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1/4 cup mixed chopped fresh basil, oregano, and chives (or 1 tsp. dried)
- Toasted bread

## Directions

Heat oil in a medium frying pan over medium heat. Add tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Simmer,
stirring occasionally, until tomatoes have softened and released their juices, about 5 minutes.

Use a spoon to make 4 wells in the tomato mixture and crack an egg into each. Cover pan and
cook until whites are firm and yolks are just starting to set, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with
cheese and cover again to melt cheese slightly, about 1 minute. Sprinkle with herbs and serve
with toast.
