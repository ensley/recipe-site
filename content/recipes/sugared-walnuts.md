At my mother’s bridal shower given by ladies of the Patterson Lutheran Church,
each attendee provided a handwritten recipe. This is one of those recipes.

## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 cup sugar
- 6 tablespoons evaporated milk
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 2-1/2 cups walnuts

## Directions

Mix cinnamon and sugar together in medium-size saucepan. Stir in evaporated milk
and salt. Boil to soft ball stage (235-240°). Remove from heat.

Stir in vanilla and walnuts. Pour onto rimmed cookie sheet and separate into 
small pieces while walnuts are cooling.
