From *The Best of Fine Cooking*. Makes a batch of 16 cookies. Use an 8" square pan
if making one batch; if doubling, use a 9x13 pan instead.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter
- 1-1/2 cups packed dark brown sugar
- 3 large egg + 1 egg yolk (room temperature)
- 1-1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1 cup + 2 Tbs. all-purpose flour
- 1/4 tsp. salt
- 3/4 cup pecans, toasted and chopped

## Directions

Heat oven to 350°. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, heat the butter and brown sugar,
stirring frequently, until the sugar has dissolved. Cook, stirring, about 1 minute longer — the
mixture will bubble but should not boil. Set the pan aside to cool for about 10-15 minutes.

Meanwhile, butter the pan, line the pan bottom with parchment, and then butter the parchment.

Stir the eggs and vanilla into the cooled sugar mixture. Add the flour, salt and nuts, stirring just
until blended. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake until the center is springy when
touched and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs
clinging to it, 25-35 minutes.

Set the pan on a rack until it’s cool enough to handle. Run a paring knife around the inside edge
of the pan and then invert the pan onto a flat surface and peel off the parchment. Flip the
blondies back onto the rack and let cool completely. Cut into squares with a sharp knife.
