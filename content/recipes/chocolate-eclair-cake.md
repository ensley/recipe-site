Very big. Press crackers down so no air pockets.

Serves 15

## Ingredients

* 1 1/4 cups sugar
* 6 tablespoons cornstarch
* 1 teaspoon table salt
* 5 cups whole milk
* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
* 5 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1 1/4 teaspoons unflavored gelatin
* 2 tablespoons water
* 2 3/4 cups heavy cream, chilled, divided
* 23 graham crackers
* 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
* 5 tablespoons light corn syrup

## Directions

Combine sugar, cornstarch and salt in large saucepan. Whisk milk into
sugar mixture until smooth and bring to boil over medium-high heat,
scraping bottom of pan with rubber spatula. Immediately reduce heat
to medium-low and cook, continuing to scrape bottom, until thickened
and large bubbles appear on surface, 4 to 6 minutes. Off heat, whisk in
butter and vanilla. Transfer pudding to large bowl and place parchment
directly on surface of pudding. Refrigerate until cool, about 2 hours.

Sprinkle gelatin over water in bowl and let sit until gelatin softens,
about 5 minutes. Microwave until mixture is bubbling around edges and
gelatin dissolves, about 10 seconds.

Using stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whip 2 cups cream on
medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high
and whip until soft peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. Add gelatin mixture and
whip until stiff peaks form, about 1 minute.

Whisk one-third of whipped cream into chilled pudding until smooth.
Fold remaining whipped cream into chilled pudding until only a few
white streaks remain. Cover bottom of 13-by-9-inch baking dish with
a layer of graham crackers, breaking crackers as necessary to line bot-
tom of pan. Top with half of pudding-whipped cream mixture (about
5 1/2 cups) and another layer of graham crackers. Repeat with remaining
pudding-whipped cream mixture and remaining graham crackers.

Combine chocolate chips, corn syrup and remaining 3/4 cup cream in
bowl and microwave on 50% power, stirring occasionally, until smooth,
1 to 2 minutes. Let glaze cool completely, about 10 minutes. Spread
glaze evenly over graham crackers and refrigerate cake for at least 6
hours or up to 2 days before serving.
